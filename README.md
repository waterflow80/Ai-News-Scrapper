# Ai-News-Radar
A website for scrapping ai news from different websites over the internet and displays them in a useful way.
This project is part of the **AI Night Challenge**, and it is proposed by **Pristini AI University**.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python3
- Streamlit (for Web)
- Selenium (a web scrapping tool)

## Overview
Depending on your internet connection, the website may seem a little bit slow on the startup, but it is actually
collection hundreds of information accross the internet and processing them before displaying them. 
So, once the processing is done, all the data will be dispplayed together and the website will become fast.

## How it works ?
- This web app searches for Ai News through different websites accross the internet, and displays 
them in a single centrilized location.
- The user can also filter the results by Day, Month and Year.
- The user can be redirected to the original article (news) site by just clicking on it.

## Future Enhancements
- We can let the user define the depth of the search. (send it in a get request)
- We can add more filters and sort options.

## Deployment
The web application will be deployed in a public server and the link will be uploaded here :down_right:
